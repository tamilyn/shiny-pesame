# Select the factors

Here you select what to use when applying the algorithm.  The algorithm
requires a factor with two levels.

You choose the dataset by either generating new test data, or combining
some multivariate data with some meta data.  

Once this data is available, you can select the factors to be used in the 
analysis.

### Choose Method

Load the data (which will be loaded and checked)
Then you will have the option to choose. (ConditionalPanel here)

then the selected button will be pushed

then based on the data, you will select what to use for your 
factors.

### Cases

* Binary variable (factor with two levels)
* Continuous variable 
* Split into two (above and below a value, default median)
* or by perctile
* multiple levels, user selects 1 more for each each of 2 options
* or take extremes (great than some value for one level, then less than some value for the other level)
